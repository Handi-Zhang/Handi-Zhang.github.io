About me
======
My name in Chinese is 张涵迪 (Zhang Handi) and I was born in Taian, Shandong, China. I have a lot of hobbies, such as playing pianos, hiking, photography, chinese caligraphy, boxing, and always love to try new things. Recently I start to do archery and learn to play the violin. I have one cute cat and three lovely dogs.
