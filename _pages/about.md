I am a Research Assistant supervised by Dr. Li Shen at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my M.A. in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science from UPenn in 2023, and B.S. in Applied Mathematics and B.A. in Economics from the University of California, San Diego in 2021.

My broad research interests involve in scientific machine learning (SciML), AI for medicine, and federated learning, including theory, algorithms, and applications to real life problems. 

I worked on the interdisciplinary methods across Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), operator learning and federated learning during my master period at UPenn. More recently, I'm working on developing and applying machine learning strategies, numerical methods and federated learning for analyzing medical data to advance the study of Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD).  

I'm actively looking for Ph.D. position in Fall 2024.
